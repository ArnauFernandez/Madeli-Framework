### Splash Screen

To use a Splash Screen on your application add this HTML code right after your `body` tag.

```html
<section class="madeli-splashscreen">
  <img class="madeli-splashscreen-image" src="assets/images/splashscreen.png"></img>
</section>
```

Then create an image called `splashscreen.png` and save it under `assets/images/` or use a custom location.
