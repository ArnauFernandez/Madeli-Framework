# Madeli-Framework
High performant, robust and simple **Material Design Framework** designed to be used on Cordova/PhoneGap SPAs (Single Page Applications). This project aims to help new HTML5/JavaScript developers (such as students) to build SPAs.

# Requirements

- Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher
- Material Design 'Roboto' Webfont (optional but highly recommended)

# Get Started

To see `Madeli Framework` in action jump to our Live Demo.

You can start a blank Madeli project by following these steps:

1. Create a folder for your project i.e "Project"

2. Create 3 subfolders inside project folder:
    - assets
    - css
    - js
  
3. Create an index.html file inside project folder and paste the following code:

```html
WORK IN PROGRESS
```

At this point you should have a folder called "Project" with 3 folders and a HTML file.

4. Download `madeli.css` and `madeli.js` and place them inside css and js folders respectively.

5. (Recommended) Download Material Design 'Roboto' webfont and place it inside /assets/fonts

6. Read the Documentation to see how to add new components and the logic behind the app by using `madeli.css` and `madeli.js`

7. Add Components and Logic to build your app.

**Important:** If you decide to add a new .css and/or .js file, please add them after the ones provided by the Framework to avoid overriding.

# Documentation

The Documentation is divided in two categories: Components and Logic.

Components provides a list of UI (User Interface) components that will let you build your application basic interface in a couple of minutes by simply copy-pasting the code.

Logic provides a list of JavaScript functions that can be used to build the application logic i.e open/close screens, open/close dialogs, etc.

Both Components and Logic make use of `madeli.css` and `madeli.js` respectively and they can be used independently.

### Components

###### Splash Screen

To use a Splash Screen on your application add this HTML code right after your `body` tag.

```html
<section class="madeli-splashscreen">
  <img class="madeli-splashscreen-image" src="assets/images/splashscreen.png"></img>
</section>
```

Then create an image called `splashscreen.png` and save it under `assets/images/` or use a custom location.

###### App Screen

To declare a new App Screen use the following code. Then you can simply insert whatever components you want inside the `content` section. Be sure to use the class `visible`, otherwise the screen won't display anything. To hide the screen change the class to `hidden` (useful if your application has a Splash Screen).

```html
<section class="madeli-appscreen visible">

  <div class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar">
    <img class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-left-icon" src=""></img>
    <p class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-title"></p>
    <img class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-right-icon" src=""></img>
    <img class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-right-icon" src=""></img>
    <img class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-right-icon" src=""></img>
  </div>

  <div class="madeli-appscreen-content">
  
  </div>
  
</section>
```

###### Toolbar

Use the following code to instate a Toolbar located at the top of the screen. Add as many right icons as you want but you may not want to put more than 3. Icons should be declared using Material Design Iconfont nomenclature, you can find the complete documentation [on Material Design Icon official page](https://material.io/icons/)

```html
<div class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar">
    <i class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-left-icon material-icons">menu</i>
    <p class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-title">Some random title</p>
    <div class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-actionbar">
        <i class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-right-icon material-icons">search</i>
        <i class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-right-icon material-icons">view_agenda</i>
        <i class="madeli-appscreen-toolbar-right-icon material-icons">more_vert</i>
    </div>
</div>
```

###### Navigation Drawer

###### Cards

Cards can be generated by using the following HTML code. You can safely remove indivual parts of the card i.e remove the Card Title.

```html
<div class="madeli-card">
  <p class="madeli-card-title">Card Title</p>
  <p class="madeli-card-text">Some random text...</p>
  <div class="madeli-card-actionbar">
    <p class="madeli-card-action">BUTTON 1</p>
    <p class="madeli-card-action">BUTTON 2</p>
    <p class="madeli-card-action">BUTTON 3</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

###### Text Inputs

###### Floating Action Button (FAB)

###### Dialog

###### Transparent Mask

###### Dark Mask
