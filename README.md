# Madeli-Framework
High performant, robust and simple **Material Design Framework** designed to be used on Cordova/PhoneGap SPAs (Single Page Applications). This project aims to help new HTML5/JavaScript developers (such as students) to build SPAs.

# Get Started

To see `Madeli Framework` in action jump to our Live Demo.

You can start a blank Madeli project by following 3 simple steps:

1. Create a new HTML page with the following code

2. Read the Documentation to see how to add new components and the logic behind the app by using `madeli.css` and `madeli.js`

3. Add Components and Logic to build your app.

**Important:** If you decide to add a new .css and/or .js file, please add them after the ones provided by the Framework to avoid overriding.

# Documentation

The Documentation is divided in two categories: Components and Logic.

Components provides a list of UI (User Interface) components that will let you build your application basic interface in a couple of minutes by simply copy-pasting the code.

Logic provides a list of JavaScript functions that can be used to build the application logic i.e open/close screens, open/close dialogs, etc.

Both Components and Logic make use of `madeli.css` and `madeli.js` respectively and of course they can be used separately.

### Components

###### Splash Screen

To use a Splash Screen on your application add this HTML code right after your `body` tag.

```html
<section class="madeli-splashscreen">
  <img class="madeli-splashscreen-image" src="assets/images/splashscreen.png"></img>
</section>
```

Then create an image called `splashscreen.png` and save it under `assets/images/` or use a custom location.

###### App Screen

###### Toolbar

###### Navigation Drawer

###### Cards

Cards can be generated by using the following HTML code. You can safely remove indivual parts of the card i.e remove the Card Title.

```html
<div class="madeli-card">
  <p class="madeli-card-title">Card Title</p>
  <p class="madeli-card-text">Some random text...</p>
  <div class="madeli-card-actionbar">
    <p class="madeli-card-action">BUTTON 1</p>
    <p class="madeli-card-action">BUTTON 2</p>
    <p class="madeli-card-action">BUTTON 3</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

###### Text Inputs
